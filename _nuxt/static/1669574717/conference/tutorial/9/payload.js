Taking advantage of strong data in knowledge graphs can make handling complex data structure possible and data visualization easier. In this workshop, you will get all the basics to start modelling data in the terms of triples and building schemas of a knowledge graph.",detailed_description:"**Short Format of your Workshop**\r\n\r\nOverview-5 min, Lecture - 30 mins, Breaks- 10 minutes, Hands-on training - 40 mins, Closing - 5 mins\r\n\r\n**Course Benefits**\r\n\r\nYou will have learnt a new skill set that may assist you in your project in data science or research. You will have a new tool that you can better model your data and collaborate with others. Also, you gain all the prerequisites to use WOQL - a query language for knowledge graph and the TerminusDB Python client to manage, manipulate and visualize data in your knowledge graph.\r\n\r\n**What is required from attendees**\r\n\r\nA computer with stable internet connection; TerminusDB Desktop App or Docker image (a.k.a TerminusDB Bootstrap) which you can download from https:\u002F\u002Fterminusdb.com\u002Fhub\u002Fdownload (FREE); Python client for TerminusDB (require Python \u003E=3.6); An opened mind and ready to learn something new",slide_link:"https:\u002F\u002Facademy.terminusdb.com\u002F",slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002Ffatx42vi",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FBkR6iXczF\u002Fedit",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fstatic\u002Fimages\u002Fdefault_head.png",name:"Cheuk Ting Ho",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FCheukting",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcheukting_ho",facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Cheuk has been a Data Scientist in various companies which demands high numerical and programmatical skills, especially in Python.

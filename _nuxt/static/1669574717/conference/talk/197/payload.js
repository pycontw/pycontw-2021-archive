However, Web UI tests are complicated and notoriously unreliable. So, how can we write tests well? Never fear!\r\n\r\nLet’s learn how to write robust, scalable Web UI tests using Python, pytest, and Selenium WebDriver that cover the full stack for any Web app. In this talk, we will write one simple test together that covers DuckDuckGo searching. You’ll learn how to write battle-hardened Web UI tests for any Web app, including Django and Flask apps. I’ll also provide plenty of hands-on tutorials and resources to continue learning after this talk.",detailed_description:"Web UI testing is difficult because many folks don't know how to do it, or they aren't experienced in how to handle fine details like locators or race conditions.

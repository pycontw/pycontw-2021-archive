We address a few common hurdles:\r\n\r\n- advanced resource scheduling for heterogenous GPU clusters\r\n- **multi-tenancy** and project isolations\r\n- customizable and consistent ML environments per project\r\n- managing jupyterlab extensions for teams\r\n- hybrid development environment such as vscode and ssh within notebook instances\r\n- **authorization and data access management**\r\n- usage reporting: allocation and utilization\r\n\r\nWe also investigate a few trends adjacent to the day-to-day jupyter environment used by data scientists and data engineers, where the roles become more cross functional in the age of MLOps:\r\n\r\n- Working with job schedulers from within Notebook\r\n- Managing ML model deployments, CI\u002FCD integration\r\n- Model monitoring and retraining",slide_link:"",slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002Fybyly6pl",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002Frk-phz9zF\u002Fedit",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fc1\u002F5f\u002Fc15f87cb62f0c0c3d24e62123e2ff3f9.jpg",name:"Chia-liang Kao",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fclkao",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fclkao",facebook_profile_url:"http:\u002F\u002Ffacebook.com\u002Fclkao",bio:"clkao (Chia-liang Kao) has been an open source software developer since 2000.

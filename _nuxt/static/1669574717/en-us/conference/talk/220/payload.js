Though it is the most popular data handling library in Python, it is quite complicated due to the rigidness of storing data in tabular formats. This is most obvious when the data stored is imported from a JSON file and end up having multiple layers of objects. At this point, you wished for a data structure that let you store data with objects and subclasses, just like in object-orientated programs. The answer? Semantic knowledge graphs.";a.detailed_description="In this talk, Cheuk will first introduce what is semantic knowledge graphs. It’s building block: triples, and how all data can be described will them - with objects and properties. Cheuk will assume no prior knowledge and will explain via examples and visualization with the TerminusDB model builder - a graphical interface that allows you to build schemas for semantic knowledge graphs.\r\n\r\nIn the next part, Cheuk will show how to construct a schema based on a pandas DataFrame. With the Python client of TemrinusDB, schema can be built programmatically follow by importing the data in the DataFrame. In this part, basic Python knowledge is assumed. In this part, Cheuk will show the internals of pandas, dissecting it and reconstruct a knowledge graph schema. Cheuk will also show the code that transforms the data and insert them in the prepared graph.\r\n\r\nFinally, Cheuk will visualize the graph in a customized interactive graph visualization in Jupyter notebook.";a.slide_link=b;a.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002Fv8gqeoiz";a.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FHJZaKgtzt\u002Fedit";a.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fstatic\u002Fimages\u002Fdefault_head.png",name:"Cheuk Ting Ho",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FCheukting",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcheukting_ho",facebook_profile_url:b,bio:"Cheuk has been a Data Scientist in various companies which demands high numerical and programmatical skills, especially in Python.

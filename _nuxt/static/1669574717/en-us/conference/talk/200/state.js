The talk begins with an introduction to digital forensics, the process of investigation, and the collection of evidence. Next, I will cover the various python modules and built-in functions required to build your first cyber forensic application. The modules covered in the discussion are pyscreenshot, Whoosh, PIL, hashlib, mutagen, pyPDF2, and pefile. Finally, I will demonstrate creating small cyber forensic applications using bulit-in modules and functions that are already to known to most of the Python programmers.",detailed_description:"NA",slide_link:"",slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F6xogf0zr\u002F",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FByfYqeKGt\u002Fedit",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fstatic\u002Fimages\u002Fdefault_head.png",name:"Gajendra Deshpande",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fgcdeshpande",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fgcdeshpande",facebook_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fgcdeshpande\u002F",bio:"Mr. Gajendra Deshpande holds a masters degree in Computer Science and Engineering and working as Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, KLS Gogte Institute of Technology, Belagavi, Karnataka, India.
